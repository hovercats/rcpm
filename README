rcpm
----

A simple package manager written in plan9's rc[1] shell.

Taking notes from kiss'[1] ease of packaging, and some of Oasis'[3] git
features we landed here.

Its designed to work in conjunction with Oasis, thus packages built is supposed
to be merged into /, similarly to Oasis.
However, there should be nothing agaist using this outside of this aswell.

Still very much WIP, so use at your own risk.

Layout
------
$pkg/
	build
	src (if using submodule)
	sha256 (not present if using submodule)
	url (not if using submodule)
	ver

Requirements
------------
- rc (Most implementations should work)
- POSIX utilities
- git
- pax
